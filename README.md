# FTAdle

It's like wordle, but instead you guess a number. The game then tells you which prime factors
your guess number shares with the target number.

Implemented in JS with a basic express app to run it with. I've also generated the prime
factorizations for the numbers I am using. For now, this is limited to primes 2,3,5,7 and
powers 0-9. I really have no idea if that is a sensible limit or not.

## Running the Game

Run `npm start` to start the express app. Until I get farther, you'll have to rely on the code
itself to show you how to use it.
